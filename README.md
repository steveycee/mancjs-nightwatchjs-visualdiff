# NighwatchJS VRT Demo for MancJS September 2023

This is a basic react app using create react app with a basic visual diff test using NightwatchVRT for presentation purposes.

## TODO:

- Get Nightwatch Running on a basic test, do I use a local app? probably should
- Get that running in a pipeline
- Get NightwatchVRT involved, get that working
- How do we handle the storage of the images for comparison if we are doing things in a build pipeline? We figure that out
